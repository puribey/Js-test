# My Boardgame Wishlist

----
## A few comments before we start
> This single web app was made for a challenge. I know it's not perfect and you may find a lot of mistakes. That's why, if you are just interested in using it, you should know there are many things to be improved. Please, feel free to fork it and add new magic to it. Take into account I'm a Junior and everything you can add to it will be of great help for my future practice. 


## Usage
1. Clone this repo or Download it.
2. Open index.html on your browser
3. Have fun (? 


## Some explanations

* You'll probably find everything commented but there are some things that I've tried using throughout the code and I couldn't use or solved. 
* I don't know how to use DB yet so I've tried with LocalStorage but I couldn't. 
* As I don't know how to use DBs I couldn't use the upload image inside the form.
* Page will go back to its initial state when refreshing (I know it sucks but I'm new at this)

## Best Wishes
I hope you have fun with my little project and I promise to improve it as soon as I can <3
